/*
Objective:
Students will create and manipulate a simple array of to-do items using anonymous functions. They will practice using filter, map, and sort to process the array and build a dynamic "To-Do List Filter" based on different criteria.
*/


// Instructions:
// Starting Point: Provide students with the following array of to-do items:
const todos = [
    { task: "Wash the dishes", completed: false, priority: 3 },
    { task: "Write a blog post", completed: true, priority: 1 },
    { task: "Buy groceries", completed: false, priority: 2 },
    { task: "Study JavaScript", completed: true, priority: 1 },
    { task: "Walk the dog", completed: false, priority: 2 },
];



/*
Tasks:
Filter Incomplete Tasks: Use filter with an anonymous function to extract all tasks that are not completed.

Sort Tasks by Priority: Use sort with an anonymous function to arrange tasks by priority, from highest (1) to lowest (3).

Mark All Tasks as Completed: Use map with an anonymous function to return a new array where all tasks are marked as completed.

Combine Filters: Filter and then sort the tasks based on incomplete status and priority.
